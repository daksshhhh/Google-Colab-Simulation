# Google-Colab-Simulation

## This project demonstrates a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation using GROMACS in Google Colab.

### Requirements
Google Colab environment with GROMACS and CMake installed.
SwissParam generated results (extracted from results.tar.gz).
Steps
Install Dependencies
Set up CMake and GROMACS in Colab.

### Molecule Preparation
Process PDB files.
Solvate system with water and ions.
Run Energy Minimization (EM)
Execute MD simulations for energy minimization.

### Analysis
Extract RMSD, RMSF, Hydrogen Bonds, and other metrics. Graphical outputs are generated for various properties.

### File Details
MD Simulation Files: Files are set up for MD simulations.
Plotting: Plots for RMSD, potential, temperature, pressure, density, and more are generated using matplotlib.
